AI for the Hex game using Monte-Carlo Tree Search

I coded it thanks to the John Levine's video "Monte Carlo Tree Search" https://youtu.be/UXW2yZndl7U

For the moment there is no graphic interface but you can play against the AI by writing coordonate of your move in the console
Optimization is also possible to improve, with a transpostition table for exemple
